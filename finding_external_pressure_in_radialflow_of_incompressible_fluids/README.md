# Reservoir Characteristics
## Types of Flow Regimes 
* Steady-state flow-.The flow regime is identified as a steady-state flow if the pressure at every location in the reservoir remains constant, i.e., does not change with time.
* Unsteady-state Flow-The unsteady-state flow (frequently called transient flow) is defined as the fluid flowing condition at which the rate of change of pressure with respect to time at any position in the reservoir is not zero or constant. This definition suggests that the pressure derivative with respect to time is essentially a function of both position i and time t,
* Pseudosteady state Flow-when the pressure at different locations in the reservoir is declining linearly as a function of time, i.e., at a constant declining rate, the flowing condition is characterized as the pseudo-steady-state flow. Mathematically, this definition states that the rate of change of pressure with respect to time at everyIt should be pointed out that the pseudo-steady state flow is commonly referred to as semi-steady-state flow and quasi-steady state flow. position is constant.

## Reservoir Fluid Types according to Compressibility 
* Incompressible Fluids-it is defined as the fluid whose volume (or density) does not change with pressure. 
* Slightly Compressible Fluids-These fluids exhibit small changes in volume, or density, with changes in pressure.
* Compressible Fluids-These are fluids that experience large changes in volume as a function of pressure. All gases are considered compressible fluids

## Types of Reservoir Geometries
* Radial Flow-The flow into or away from  a wellbore will follow radial flow lines. Because fluids move toward the well from all directions and coverage at the wellbore.
* Linear Flow-Linear flow occurs when flow paths are parallel and the fluid flows in a single direction. In addition, the cross sectional area to flow must be constant.
* Spherical and Hemispherical Flow-Depending upon the type of wellbore completion configuration, it is possible to have a spherical or hemispherical flow near the wellbore. A well with a limited perforated interval could result in spherical flow in the vicinity of the perforations. A well that only partially penetrates the pay zone,could result in hemispherical flow.




## Number of flowing fluids in the reservoir 
* Single-phase flow (oil, water, or gas)
* Two-phase flow (oil-water, oil-gas, or gas-water)
* Three phase flow (oil, water, and gas)
